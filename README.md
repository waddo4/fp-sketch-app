[Papillon](https://waddo4.github.io/fp-sketch-app/) is a drawing application that focuses on colours and symmetry. User can signup for an account and create artworks using the drawing canvas.

## Architecture and models
    
Papillon is designed to have users being able to create and save their own artworks and have the option to publish them to a public gallery. It includes Supabase authentication for user login and signup using email & password and uses the Supabase database for saving and retrieving user's drawings.

## Technologies used

  - Vue 3 w/ Vite
  - Supabase v.^2.10.0
  - Tailwindcss v.^3.2.7
  - jQuery v.^3.6.3

## Improvement ideas & additional features

  - Users will have the oppurtunity to create a username and add an avatar for their profile when registering. They will then have the ability to edit these details and add a description about themself.
  - Users can save their artworks to the database and have them show on their profile page. The user can then select to publish their artwork to a public gallery which shows artworks from all users.
  - Add an option for different brush-styles when drawing on the canvas.
  - Add an option to add additional lines of reflection.
